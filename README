This is a lab I am very proud of. Ultimately it mimics a Linked
Indexed List based on the Java API's Linked Indexed List but the logic implemented is what I learned in one of my
classes. This code also implements a structre created by my proffessor. This gave us 
usefull tools to help us code the Linked Indexed List. I have many examples like this and these snippets of code tell
a story of my time being a computer science major. I am very fond of all
my code and I canâ€™t wait to show you a bit more of what I can do.
